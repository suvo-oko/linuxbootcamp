# Manage Azure disks with the Azure CLI

Azure virtual machines (VMs) use disks to store the operating system, applications, and data.

## Default Azure disks

When an Azure virtual machine is created, two disks are automatically attached to the virtual machine.

### Operating system disk

Operating system disks can be sized up to 2 TB, and hosts the VMs operating system. The OS disk is labeled `/dev/sda` by default. **The OS disk should not be used for applications or data**. For applications and data, use data disks.

### Temporary disk

**Temporary disks use a solid-state drive that is located on the same Azure host as the VM**. The size of the temporary disk is determined by the VM size. Temporary disks are labeled `/dev/sdb` and have a mountpoint of `/mnt`.

## Azure data disks

To install applications and store data, additional data disks can be added. **Data disks should be used in any situation where durable and responsive data storage is desired**.

## VM disk types

Azure provides two types of disks.

### Standard disks

Backed by HDDs, and delivers cost-effective storage while still being performant. Standard disks are ideal for a cost effective dev and test workload.

### Premium disks

Backed by SSD-based, high-performance, low-latency disk. Perfect for VMs running production workload. *VM sizes with an S in the size name typically support Premium Storage*.

## Create and attach disks

### Attach disk at VM creation

To attach a data disk when a VM is first created, we add the `--data-disk-sizes-gb` parameter to the `az vm create` command.

```bash
az vm create \
-g cloudskillsrg \
-n UbuntuVM3 \
--image UbuntuLTS \
--size Standard_DS2_v2 \
--admin-username rmira \
--generate-ssh-keys \
--data-disk-sizes-gb 128 128
```

### Attach disks to an existing VM

To create and attach a new disk to an existing virtual machine, use the `az vm disk attach` command.

```bash
az vm disk attach \
-g cloudskillsrg \
--vm-name UbuntuVM2 \
--name DataDisk1 \
--size-gb 128 \
--sku Premium_LRS \
--new
```

## Prepare data disks

Once a disk has been attached to the virtual machine, the operating system needs to be configured to use the disk.

We use the `lsblk` command to display details about block devices. These block devices are basically those files that represent devices connected to the pc.
After attaching a data disk to my existing Ubuntu machine, I get this output when I run `lsblk`:

![lsblk](images/lsblk.png)

`sda` is the operating system disk, `sdb` is the temporary disk and `sdc` is the data disk.

To partition the data disk, we use the `parted` command:

`sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mklabel gpt mkpart xfspart xfs 0% 100%`

The `mkfs` command writes a filesystem to the partition:

`sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdc1`

The `partprobe` command makes the system aware of the change:

`sudo partprobe /dev/sdc1`

To make the disk accessible we need to mount it:

`sudo mkdir /datadisk1 && sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /datadisk1`

We can see the disk is mounted by running the `df -h` command:

`df -h | grep -i "sd"`

And this is the output:

![df -h](images/df.png)

And here's the disk in the filesystem:

## Take a disk snapshot

When you take a disk snapshot, Azure creates a read only, point-in-time copy of the disk. Azure VM snapshots are useful to quickly save the state of a VM before you make configuration changes. In the event of an issue or error, VM can be restored using a snapshot. When a VM has more than one disk, a snapshot is taken of each disk independently of the others. **To take application consistent backups, consider stopping the VM before you take disk snapshots**.

### Create snapshot

I encountered an error when creating a snapshot using the `az snapshot create`.
I'm running Azure CLI 2.30.0 and this version introduces a breaking change. The `--copy-start` parameter needs to be set to false for subscriptions which don't support CopyStart. By default, it's set to true.

I ran this command and it worked:

```bash
az snapshot create \
    --resource-group cloudskillsrg \
    --source "$osdiskid" \
    --name osdisk-snapshot
    --copy-start false
```

### Create disk from snapshot

```bash
az disk create \
   --resource-group cloudskillsrg \
   --name UbuntuSnapshotDisk \
   --source osdisk-snapshot
```

### Restore VM from snapshot

First we delete the VM by running `az vm delete`, then we create a new VM from the snapshot, with the following command:

```bash
az vm create \
    --resource-group cloudskillsrg \
    --name UbuntuVM2 \
    --attach-os-disk UbuntuSnapshotDisk \
    --os-type linux
```

### Reattach data disk

This command will result in the data disk available to be reattached. Thr Microsoft Docs tutorial stores the output of this command in a variable, but I wanted to see how this output looks like, so I ran the command and copied the resulting disk name.

```bash
az disk list \
   -g  \
   --query "[?contains(name,'UbuntuVM2')].[id]" \
   -o tsv
```

```bash
az vm disk attach \
   â€“g cloudskillsrg \
   --vm-name UbuntuVM2 \
   --name UbuntuVM2_OsDisk_1_5999736262a54d9193479baa26fa7e33
```
